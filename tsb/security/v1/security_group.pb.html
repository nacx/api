<p>Security Groups allow grouping the sidecars in a set of namespaces
owned by its parent workspace. Security related configurations can
then be applied on the group to control the behavior of these
sidecars. The group can be in one of two modes: <code>TETRATE</code> and
<code>ISTIO</code>. <code>TETRATE</code> mode is a minimalistic mode that allows users to
quickly configure the most commonly used features in the service
mesh using Tetrate specific APIs, while the <code>ISTIO</code> mode provides
more flexibility for power users by allowing them to configure the
sidecar&rsquo;s security properties using a restricted subset of Istio
Security APIs.</p>

<p>The following example creates a security group for the sidecars in
<code>ns1</code>, <code>ns2</code> and <code>ns3</code> namespaces owned by its parent workspace
<code>w1</code> under tenant <code>mycompany</code></p>

<pre><code class="language-yaml">apiVersion: security.tsb.tetrate.io/v1
kind: Group
metadata:
  name: t1
  workspace: w1
  tenant: mycompany
spec:
  namespaceSelectors:
  - name: */ns1
  - name: */ns2
  - name: */ns3
  configMode: TETRATE
</code></pre>

<p>And the associated security settings for the sidecars in the group</p>

<pre><code class="language-yaml">apiVersion: security.tsb.tetrate.io/v1
kind: SecuritySetting
metadata:
  name: defaults
  group: t1
  workspace: w1
  tenant: mycompany
spec:
  authentication: REQUIRED
</code></pre>

<p>Under the hood, Service Bridge translates these minimalistic
settings into Istio APIs such as <code>PeerAuthentication</code>,
<code>AuthorizationPolicy</code>, etc. for the namespaces managed by the
security group. These APIs are then pushed to the Istio control
planes of clusters where the workspace is applicable.</p>

<p>It is possible to create a security group for namespaces in a
specific cluster as long as the parent workspace owns those
namespaces in that cluster. For example,</p>

<pre><code class="language-yaml">apiVersion: security.tsb.tetrate.io/v1
kind: Group
metadata:
  name: t1
  workspace: w1
  tenant: mycompany
spec:
  namespaceSelectors:
  - name: c1/ns1 # pick ns1 namespace only from c1 cluster
  - name: */ns2
  - name: */ns3
  configMode: TETRATE
</code></pre>

<p>In the <code>ISTIO</code> mode, it is possible to directly attach Istio
<code>PeerAuthentication</code>, <code>RequestAuthentication</code>, and
<code>AuthorizationPolicy</code> to the security group. These configurations
will be validated for correctness and conflict free operations and
then pushed to the appropriate Istio control planes.</p>

<p>The following example declares a <code>PeerAuthentication</code> policy for a
specific workload in the <code>ns1</code> namespace:</p>

<pre><code class="language-yaml">apiVersion: security.istio.io/v1beta1
kind: PeerAuthentication
metadata:
  name: workload-mtls-disable
  namespace: ns1
  annotations:
    tsb.tetrate.io/tenant: mycompany
    tsb.tetrate.io/workspace: w1
    tsb.tetrate.io/securityGroup: t1
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: reviews
  mtls:
    mode: DISABLE
</code></pre>

<p>The namespace where the Istio APIs are applied will need to be part
of the parent security group. In addition, each API object will need
to have annotations to indicate the tenant, workspace and the
security group to which it belongs to.</p>

<p>TODO(rshriram): Document the list of fields in Istio APIs that are
disallowed.</p>
