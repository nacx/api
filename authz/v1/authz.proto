// Runtime Authorization Policy
//
// Runtime authorization policies are attached to specific resources and define which subjects,
// and under which conditions, are allowed to access them.
// Different subjects can be configured to access the target resource with different conditions
// by setting multiple bindings in the same policy.
//
// The default authorization policy allows access between services within an application, and denies
// cross-application traffic. Traffic between applications must be explicitly enabled by applying
// the corresponding access policy in the target application.
//
// THe following examples show some common policies:
//
//     # Default deny policy for applications. The absence of bindings means that there is no
//     # access allowed from outside the application.
//     policy:
//
//     # Allow access from the 'bookinfo' application. Requests from the client application
//     # present a JWT token for the 'bookinfo' application.
//     policy:
//       bindings:
//       - from:
//         - jwt:
//             principal: bookinfo
//             audience: tsb
//             claims:
//               group: applications
//
//     # Allow access from the 'bookinfo' application, but only to the '/v1/*'
//     # HTTP paths, and only for GET and HEAD requests, on the 'bookinfo.com' host.
//     policy:
//       bindings:
//       - from:
//         - jwt:
//             principal: bookinfo
//             audience: tsb

//     # HTTP paths, and only for GET and HEAD requests, on the 'bookinfo.com' host.
